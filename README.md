## Welcome to UKL repository

This Repository will offer Installation files for Uighur Latin keyboard layouts and Uighur Cyrillic keyboard layouts for Different Operation Systems; the work is stilling unfinished, and it would be appreciatable if you could make a contribution.

### Updating info

Till 7 June, 2017, there finished versions are Latin alphabet for Windows (tested in Windows 10, 64-bit), Latin Alphabet and Cyrillic Alphabet for Mac OS X (tested in Sierra, 10.12.5). 

Both the iOS versions are in progress.

* Please make sure that you already turned off the function "Correct Spelling automatically" in System Preference - Keyboard - Text, or the correction system would annoy you so much by "correcting" some of the Uighur words into silimar-looking English words
